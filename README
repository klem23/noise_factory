SYNTH

       Beat Factory
                Simple synth that allow to design BEAT (or drumkit kick), heart
                of the House/Techno music. You can play with the
                amplitude(volume) and the frequency enveloppe of the beat.


       Beat Factory Tuned
		Same as Beat Factory but keyboard pitch is taken in account.
		It could have been an option in Beat Factory, but my code 
		design decide another way.....

	Dub Mermaid
		Classic Dub Siren with big LFO and several keyboard mode
		Keyboard mode 0 : tone mode : classic synth behaviour
		Keyboard mode 1 : switch mode : on/off mode with each
						key press
		Keyboard mode 2 : alarm mode : standard alarm pitching
						(rise, sustain, drop)

	Classic Synth
		2 Classical Oscillators + Recursive Filter
		The classical but usefull synthetizer composed of two
		oscillators (with enveloppe and LFO) and a digital 
		filter.

	Wave Factory
		Wave Draw + Convolution Filter
		This synthetizer allow you to draw (like paint) the 
		base wave you want to repeat to generate your sound.
		It's associated with a filter where you can draw (like
		paint) the frequency response of you filter.
		

	Spectrum Factory
		Spectrum Draw + Spectrum Filter
		This synthetizer allow to draw (like paint) the spectrum
		of your instrument and of your filter.
                It's Midi pitched as it use the keyboard key to pitch
                this spectrum to the key frequency and you can shift 
		the frequency of the filter spectrum at any time.



FX

	Simple Delay
		Classic and standard unbreakable delay.

	Loop Delay
		Delay using random loop for echoes.



Generator

        Classic Oscillator
                The classical but always usefull oscillator with its
                4 classical wave (sin/square/saw up/saw down/triangle)
                Frequency enveloppe and LFO
                Amplitude enveloppe and LFO

        Wave Drawer
                The Hertz unit is used to mesure the frequency of a
                phenomen that repeat itself and the sound is matter
                wave that repeat itself, but it can look like quite
                anything (even if it will be noise)...
                So this synth allow you to draw (like paint) the wave
                you want to repeat to generate sound or more likely
                noise most of the time.
                It's Midi pitched.

        Spectrum Drawer
                This synth allow you to draw (like paint) the spectrum
                of the sound you want to generate.
                It's Midi pitched as it use the keyboard key to pitch
                this spectrum to the key frequency.



Filter

        Recursive Filter
                Standard Digital Recursive Filter (IIR)
                Design from

        Convolution Filter
                This filter allow you to draw (like paint) the spectrum
                response of your filter. It will generate a kernel with an
                inverse FFT that will convolute withe input.

        Spectrum Filter
                This filter allow you to draw (like paint) the spectrum
                response of your filter. Also you can shift the frequency
                of the filter spectrum at any time.
                It will use a FFT, multiply the input signal with the
                filter spectrum and use an inverse FFT.



===================
COMPILE
===================

Dependencies:
 - lib osc
 - lib samplerate
 - lib fftw
 - Qt
 - Qwt

Use scons tools to compile.


In case of trouble with Qt compilation, go in file :
/usr/lib/scons/SCons/Tool/qt.py
and remove line 250 :
QT_LIB = 'qt', # may be set to qt-mt

There is no such linking in Qt.
